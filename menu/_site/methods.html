<h3>Alternative approaches for deriving product embeddings</h3>

<p>Below, we list some of the existing approaches for learning (product) embeddings that are
alternatives to Product2Vec, as used in P2V-MAP. The derived embeddings can be reduced to
two dimensions with UMAP or t-SNE, yielding product maps. They can also be used as a basis
for recommender systems or other retail analytics tasks.</p>

<h4>Shopper (Ruiz, Athey, and Blei 2020)</h4>

<p>SHOPPER is a probabilistic model designed to generate item embeddings from consumer
shopping data, particularly focusing on substitutes and complements. By learning latent
attributes of items, similar to word embeddings in language models, SHOPPER captures how
items interact in a shopping basket, accounting for factors like customer preferences,
seasonality, and price sensitivity.</p>

<h4>LDA-X (Jacobs, Donkers, and Fok 2016)</h4>

<p>The paper presents LDA-X, an extension of the LDA model that can include covariates. LDA-X
is a model-based approach for purchase prediction in large retail assortments using
embeddings. These embeddings capture customer preferences and product relationships, which
can then be used to predict future purchases.</p>

<h4>Triple2Vec (Fionda and Pirro 2019)</h4>

<p>Triple2Vec is a method for learning triple embeddings from knowledge graphs. Unlike
previous approaches that focus on embedding nodes, Triple2Vec directly embeds graph edges
(triples) using a line graph representation and random walks to capture relationships
between triples. The method extends graph embedding techniques by introducing edge
weighting mechanisms that incorporate semantic proximity for knowledge graphs and
centrality for homogeneous graphs. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like
triple classification and clustering, as it improves representation quality by preserving
the semantic structure of knowledge graphs.</p>

<h4>Item2Vec (Barkan &amp; Koenigstein 2016)</h4>

<p>Item2Vec is a neural embedding technique designed for collaborative filtering. Similar to
Word2Vec, Item2Vec adapts the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS) method to create
embeddings for items rather than words. The key contribution of Item2Vec is its ability to
compute item-item relationships directly without relying on user data, making it
particularly useful in environments where user-item interaction data is unavailable. The
paper demonstrates that Item2Vec outperforms traditional SVD-based methods, especially for
less popular items, thus offering improved recommendations and item similarity measures in
large-scale data sets.</p>

<h4>GloVe (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014)</h4>

<p>The GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) model is an unsupervised learning
algorithm that generates word embeddings by leveraging the co-occurrence statistics of
words within a large corpus. GloVe combines the strengths of matrix factorization
techniques and local context window methods to capture semantic relationships between
words in a vector space. The model’s primary contribution is its ability to generate
meaningful word vectors that can be used in tasks like word analogy, word similarity, and
named entity recognition. The method can be applied to market basket data.</p>

<h4>Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013)</h4>

<p>The Word2Vec model introduces an efficient approach to learning word embeddings that
capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words by learning how to predict the
context of a word. Word2Vec’s contribution is in its ability to capture complex word
relationships using simple neural network architectures, while being computationally
efficient for large data sets. The embeddings produced by Word2Vec are useful in various
NLP tasks (e.g., word analogy, similarity detection); Word2Vec can be applied to market
basket data.</p>
